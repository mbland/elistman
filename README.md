# EListMan - Email List Manager

Mailing list system providing address validation and unsubscribe URIs.

_**NOTE:** This project is just beginning. When it's operational, I'll remove
this notice._

Only serves one list at a time as defined by deployment parameters. (_I may
change this in a future version._)

Implemented in [Go][] using the following [Amazon Web Services][]:

- [API Gateway][]
- [Lambda][]
- [DynamoDB][]
- [Simple Email Service][]

Uses [CloudFormation][] and the [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)][] for
deploying the Lambda function, binding to the API Gateway, managing permissions,
and other configuration parameters.

Based on implementation hints from [victoriadrake/simple-subscribe][], but
otherwise contains original code.

## Prerequisites

### Install tools

Run the `bin/check-tools.sh` script to check that the required tools are
installed.

- This script will try to install some missing tools itself. If any are missing,
  the script will provide a link to installation instructions.

- **Note**: The script does _not_ check for the presence of `make`, as it comes
  in many flavors and aliases and already ships with many operating systems. The
  notable exception is Microsoft Windows.

  However, if the `winget` command is available, you can install the
  [GnuWin32.Make][] package:

  ```cmd
  winget install -e --id GnuWin32.Make
  ```

  Then:
  - Press _**Win-R**_ and enter `systempropertiesadvanced` to open the _**System
    Properties > Advanced**_ pane.
  - Click the _**Environment Variables...**_ button.
  - Select _**Path**_ in either the _User variables_ or _System variables_ pane,
    then click the corresponding _**Edit...**_ button.
  - Click the _**New**_ button, then click the _**Browse...**_ button.
  - Navigate to _**This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Program Files (x86) > GnuWin32 > bin**_.
  - Click the _**OK**_ button, then keep clicking the _**OK**_ button until all
    of the _**System Properties**_ panes are closed.

  Make should then be available as either `make` or `make.exe`.

### Configure the AWS CLI

Configure your credentials for a region from the **Email Receiving Endpoints**
section of [Amazon Simple Email Service endpoints and quotas][].

Follow the guidance on the [AWS Command Line Interface: Quick Setup][] page if
necessary.

### Configure AWS Simple Email Service (SES)

Set up SES in the region selected in the above step. Make sure to enable DKIM
and create a verified domain identity per [Verifying your domain for Amazon SES
email receiving][].

Assuming you have your AWS CLI environment set up correctly, this should confirm
that SES is properly configured (with your own identity listed, of course):

```sh
$ aws sesv2 list-email-identities

{
    "EmailIdentities": [
        {
            "IdentityType": "DOMAIN",
            "IdentityName": "mike-bland.com",
            "SendingEnabled": true,
            "VerificationStatus": "SUCCESS"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configure AWS API Gateway

Set up a custom domain name in API Gateway in the region selected in the
above step. Create a SSL certificate in Certificate Manager for it as well.

- [Setting up custom domain names for HTTP APIs][]

If done correctly, the following command should produce output resembling the
example:

```sh
$ aws apigatewayv2 get-domain-names

{
    "Items": [
        {
            "ApiMappingSelectionExpression": "$request.basepath",
            "DomainName": "api.mike-bland.com",
            "DomainNameConfigurations": [
                {
                    "ApiGatewayDomainName": "<...>",
                    "CertificateArn": "<...>",
                    "DomainNameStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                    "EndpointType": "REGIONAL",
                    "HostedZoneId": "<...>",
                    "SecurityPolicy": "TLS_1_2"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Create the DynamoDB table

Run the `bin/create-subscribers-table.sh` script to create the DynamoDB table,
using a table name of your choice. Then run `aws dynamodb list-tables` to
confirm that the new table is present.

## Deployment

Create a `deploy.env` file in the root directory of the following form
(replacing each value with your own as appropriate):

```sh
API_DOMAIN_NAME="api.mike-bland.com"
API_ROUTE_KEY="email"
EMAIL_DOMAIN_NAME="mike-bland.com"
SENDER_NAME="Mike Bland's blog"
SUBSCRIBERS_TABLE_NAME="TABLE_NAME"
```

Then run `make deploy`.

## URI Schema

- `https://<api_hostname>/<route_key>/<operation>`
- `mailto:unsubscribe@<email_hostname>?subject=<email>%20<uid>`

Where:

- `<api_hostname>`: Hostname for the API Gateway instance
- `<route_key>`: Route key for the API Gateway
- `<operation>`: Endpoint for the list management operation:
  - `/subscribe/<email>`
  - `/verify/<email>/<uid>`
  - `/unsubscribe/<email>/<uid>`
- `<email>`: Subscriber's URI encoded (for `https`) or query encoded (for
  `mailto`) email address
- `<uid>`: Identifier assigned to the subscriber by the system
- `<email_hostname>`: Hostname serving as an SES verified identity for receiving email

## Development

The [Makefile](./Makefile) is very short and readable. Use it to run common
tasks, or learn common commands from it to use as you please.

## Algorithms

Unless otherwise noted, all responses will be [HTTP 303 See Other][], with the
target page specified in the [Location HTTP header][].

- The one exception will be unsubscribe requests from mail clients using the
  `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post` email headers.

### Generating a new subscriber verification link

1. An HTTP request from the API Gateway comes in, containing the email address
   of a potential subscriber.
1. Validate the email address.
   1. Parse the name as closely as possible to [RFC 5322 Section 3.2.3][].
   1. Reject any common aliases, like "no-reply" or "postmaster."
   1. Check the MX record of the host, or find an A or AAAA record that accepts
      connections on port 587 or 2525.
   1. If it fails validation, return the `INVALID` page.
1. Look for an existing DynamoDB record for the email address.
   1. If it exists and `SubscriberStatus` is `Verified`, return the
      `ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED` page.
1. Generate a UID.
1. Write a DynamoDB record containing the email address, the UID, a timestamp,
   and with `SubscriberStatus` set to `Unverified`.
1. Generate a verification link using the email address and UID.
1. Send the verification link to the email address.
   1. If the mail bounces or fails to send, return the `INVALID` page.
1. Return the `CONFIRM` page.

### Responding to a subscriber verification link

1. An HTTP request from the API Gateway comes in, containing a subscriber's
   email address and UID.
1. Check whether there is a record for the email address in DynamoDB.
   1. If not, return the `NOT_FOUND` page.
1. Check whether the UID matches that from the DynamoDB record.
   1. If not, return the `NOT_FOUND` page.
1. Set the `SubscriberStatus` of the record to `Verified`.
1. Send a `SUBSCRIBED` email containing the unsubscribe link.
1. Return the `SUBSCRIBED` page.

### Responding to an unsubscribe request

1. Either an HTTP Request from the API Gateway or a mailto: event from SES comes
   in, containing a subscriber's email address and UID.
1. Check whether there is a record for the email address in DynamoDB.
   1. If not, return the `NOT_FOUND` page.
1. Check whether the UID matches that from the DynamoDB record.
   1. If not, return the `NOT_FOUND` page.
1. Delete the DynamoDB record for the email address.
1. If the request was an HTTP Request:
   1. If it uses the `POST` method, and the data contains
      `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`, return [HTTP 204 No Content][].
   1. Otherwise return the `UNSUBSCRIBED` page.

### Expiring unused subscriber verification links

1. Retrieve all existing DynamoDB records.
1. Delete any `Unverified` records exceeding the timeout (1h).
